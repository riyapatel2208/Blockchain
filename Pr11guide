Brownie Simple Storage — Complete step-by-step guide (Windows, use `python`)

This single text file contains everything to run PatrickAlphaC/brownie_simple_storage on another Windows machine where the Python binary is `python` (not `python3`).

---

## PREREQUISITES

• Windows 10/11
• Python 3.8+ installed and `python` available on PATH
• Git installed (for `git clone`)
• MetaMask extension (for testnet account)

---

1. OPEN A NEW POWERSHELL (or CMD) WINDOW

---

Always open a fresh terminal window when following these steps.

2. INSTALL pipx (preferred) and Brownie

---

# Install pipx and ensure PATH (use `python`)

python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath

# Close and re-open the terminal after `ensurepath` runs.

# Install Brownie with pipx

pipx install eth-brownie

# If pipx installation fails, fallback to pip:

python -m pip install --user eth-brownie

3. CLONE THE REPO

---

cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop    # or any folder you want
git clone [https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/brownie_simple_storage](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/brownie_simple_storage)
cd brownie_simple_storage

4. INSTALL solc (manual) — fixes 403 errors

---

python -m pip install py-solc-x

# Install the exact compiler version used by the project (0.6.0)

python -m solcx.install 0.6.0

If installation was blocked or fails, find where solc got installed and set SOLCX_BINARY_PATH (rare). Restart the terminal afterwards.

5. VERIFY COMPILATION

---

brownie compile

Expected output snippet:
Compiling contracts...
Solc version: 0.6.0
Generating build data...
Project has been compiled. Build artifacts saved at <project>\build\contracts

6. RUN TESTS

---

brownie test

Expected: tests pass (example: "2 passed")

7. RUN LOCAL DEPLOY (development network)

---

brownie run scripts/deploy.py

This will start a temp Ganache instance, deploy, and print addresses and transaction info. The temporary chain will be terminated after the script completes.

8. USE BROWNIE CONSOLE (local)

---

brownie console

# In console (type these lines one by one):

from brownie import SimpleStorage, accounts
contract = SimpleStorage.deploy({'from': accounts[0]})    # deploy inside console
contract.retrieve()
contract.store(25, {'from': accounts[0]})
contract.retrieve()

Note: Deployments on the dev chain are ephemeral. A new console session creates a new chain with no prior deployments.

9. PREPARE for SEPOLIA TESTNET DEPLOYMENT

---

A) Create a .env file in the project root (exact filename: .env)

# .env contents (use a test/account with small test ETH only):

PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID_HERE

• Make sure the private key starts with 0x. If MetaMask copies it without 0x, prepend 0x.
• Do NOT commit this file to git or share the key.

B) Confirm brownie-config.yaml includes dotenv and wallet variables. Replace or ensure it has:

compiler:
solc:
version: "0.6.0"

dotenv: .env

wallets:
from_key: ${PRIVATE_KEY}

networks:
sepolia:
host: [https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/${WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID}](https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/${WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID})
chainid: 11155111

10. EDIT scripts/deploy.py (recommended final version)

---

Replace contents of scripts/deploy.py with the following minimal script:

from brownie import SimpleStorage, accounts, config

def main():
account = accounts.add(config["wallets"]["from_key"])
print("Using account:", account.address)
simple_storage = SimpleStorage.deploy({"from": account})
print("Contract deployed at:", simple_storage.address)

11. RESTART TERMINAL (Windows) — ensure .env picked up

---

Close PowerShell and reopen it, then `cd` into the project folder again:
cd path\to\brownie_simple_storage

Note: Brownie reads .env automatically (because we set `dotenv: .env`). Restarting helps on Windows.

12. DEPLOY to SEPOLIA

---

# Run this command (make sure you have Sepolia test ETH):

brownie run scripts/deploy.py --network sepolia

Expected successful output example:
Using account: 0x82599...dc4ef
Transaction sent: 0xabc123...
SimpleStorage deployed at: 0x9F1234abcd5678Ef90abcd1234567890abcd1234

If you see "ValueError: private key must be exactly 32 bytes" — it means Brownie read an empty PRIVATE_KEY. Check .env location/format.

13. INTERACT with the deployed contract (Sepolia)

---

brownie console --network sepolia

# In console:

from brownie import SimpleStorage, accounts, config
acct = accounts.add(config["wallets"]["from_key"])  # your wallet
contract = SimpleStorage[-1]
contract.retrieve()
tx = contract.store(42, {"from": acct})
tx.wait(1)
contract.retrieve()

14. OPTIONAL — VERIFY on Etherscan automatically

---

Add your Etherscan API key to .env as ETHERSCAN_TOKEN=your_key and run with publish_source:

# Update deploy.py (deploy and verify)

from brownie import SimpleStorage, accounts, config

def main():
account = accounts.add(config["wallets"]["from_key"])
simple_storage = SimpleStorage.deploy({"from": account}, publish_source=True)
print("Deployed & verified at:", simple_storage.address)

Then run:
Brownie run scripts/deploy.py --network sepolia

15. TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST

---

• If `brownie` command not found: check pipx install and PATH, or use `python -m pip install --user eth-brownie` then restart terminal.
• If solc 403 errors: install solc manually with solcx (`python -m solcx.install 0.6.0`).
• If `ValueError: private key must be exactly 32 bytes`: .env not loaded or PRIVATE_KEY malformed. Ensure .env exists, no quotes, starts with 0x, and `dotenv: .env` in brownie-config.yaml.
• If `IndexError: list index out of range` when using SimpleStorage[-1]: you are connected to a fresh local chain with no deployments — deploy in the same session first.
• File names: ensure `.env` is not `.env.txt`. In Windows Explorer enable file extensions to check.

16. EXPECTED FINAL OUTPUTS (for examiner)

---

• Successful compile: "Project has been compiled"
• Successful tests: "2 passed" (or tests passed)
• Local deploy: prints deployed address
• Sepolia deploy: prints deployed Sepolia address and tx hash
• Console interaction: retrieve() returns values before and after store()

17. SECURITY NOTES

---

• Never use your main wallet’s private key for practice. Create and use a disposable wallet with small test ETH.
• Keep .env out of source control. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`.

---

## SAVE THIS FILE

Save this file exactly as:

Run_Brownie_Simple_Storage_Windows_using_python.txt

Place it inside the project root so others can run the project by following these steps verbatim.

If you want, I can now generate a ready-to-download PDF or the TXT file inside the canvas for you.
